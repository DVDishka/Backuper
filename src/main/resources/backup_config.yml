# (Path list) (An example of how to set a list is below) Full directory paths to folders/files that you want to be backed up. Worlds will be backed up automatically, so you do not need to specify world folders there (For example, you can specify "plugins", "config") You can also specify all files with "*".

# (Path list) (An example of how to set a list is below) Full directory paths to folders/files that you want to be excluded from backup. If you want to backup everything from the folder1 except some folder1/file1, you can specify folder1 in addDirectoryToBackup and folder1/file1 in excludeDirectoryFromBackup. (The backupsFolder directory will be excluded automatically to prevent the loop)
